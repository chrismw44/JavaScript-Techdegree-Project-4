# JavaScript-Techdegree-Project-4

Browser-based, word guessing game. JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

The code chooses a random phrase, splits the phrase into letters, and puts those letters onto the gameboard.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, that letter will be disabled on the onscreen keyboard.

CSS STYLE CHANGES MADE:
-Title changed in index.html
-Background images added to start, win and lose overlays.
-Text shadow added to title.
-Colour of header changed to white.
-Background image of game added.
-When a correct letter is guessed, the font colour is now black and the      background colour of the tiles is white.
-The photos were taken by me, so no copyright issues.
